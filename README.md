# The Ghost of T.S.Eliot by Ruby Childs

The Ghost of T.S.Eliot displays a set of generated poems, alongside headphones playing a reading of the poems. With new advances in machine learning a computer becomes more and more creative in its own right. This project explores whether an artist can continue eternally; not only through pre-existing works, but new works, created by using machine learning. This piece used a Recurrent Neural Network trained on T.S.Eliotâ€™s poetry to generate new, unseen poems.
